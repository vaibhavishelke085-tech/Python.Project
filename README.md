Part 1 –In this program, I used the input() function to collect the user’s name, age, and city. These values are stored in variables. To display the output in a clean and readable sentence, I used an f-string. F-strings allow variables to be embedded directly inside a string, making the output easy to format and understand.
This part demonstrates basic input handling and string formatting in Python.
Output:-
Enter your name: Vaibhavi
Enter your age: 23
Enter your city: Pune
My name is Vaibhavi, I am 23 years old, and I live in Pune.

Part 2 –In this program, I used a dictionary to store characters as keys and their counts as values. I iterated through each character in the input string using a for loop. If the character already existed in the dictionary, I increased its count by one. If it did not exist, I added it to the dictionary with a count of one.
This part demonstrates the use of dictionaries, loops, and string iteration in Python.
Output:-
Enter a word or sentence: Hi, I am Vaibhavi.
Character count: {'H': 1, 'i': 3, ',': 1, ' ': 3, 'I': 1, 'a': 3, 'm': 1, 'V': 1, 'b': 1, 'h': 1, 'v': 1, '.': 1}

Part 3 –In this program, I created an empty list to store numbers entered by the user. Using a for loop, I asked the user to enter five numbers one by one and converted them to float before adding them to the list. After collecting all numbers, I used Python’s built-in functions: sum() to calculate the total, len() to find the number of elements for calculating the average, and max() to determine the largest number in the list.
This part demonstrates working with lists, loops, and aggregate functions in Python.
Output:-Please enter 5 numbers:
Enter number 1: 5
Enter number 2: 23
Enter number 3: 67
Enter number 4: 98
Enter number 5: 5

--- Results ---
List of numbers: [5.0, 23.0, 67.0, 98.0, 5.0]
Sum: 198.0
Average: 39.6
Largest Number: 98.0

Through this task, I demonstrated basic Python programming skills including user input handling, dictionary mapping, string iteration, list operations, and aggregate calculations. The code is written clearly and logically, with a focus on readability and correct output.
